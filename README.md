# Valentine's Day Proposal Website 💕

A beautiful, interactive Valentine's Day website to ask your special someone to be your Valentine!

## Features

- 💖 Beautiful gradient backgrounds with animated hearts
- 📱 Fully responsive design (works perfectly on phones)
- ✨ Interactive animations and effects
- 🎮 Fun "No" button that runs away when you try to click it
- 🎉 Celebration screen with falling hearts
- 💝 Click-to-create hearts on the celebration screen

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open your browser and visit the URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:3000)

4. To view on your phone, make sure your phone is on the same WiFi network and use the network URL shown in the terminal

## How It Works

1. **Intro Screen**: A welcoming screen with a pulsing heart
2. **Question Screen**: The big question with Yes/No buttons (the No button is playful and moves away!)
3. **Celebration Screen**: A beautiful celebration when she says Yes! 🎉

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` folder.

## Tips

- Share the URL with your girlfriend when she's ready
- The website works great on mobile phones
- The "No" button gets smaller and the "Yes" button gets bigger each time she tries to hover over "No" 😉

Good luck! 💕
